# 42 Butterflies #

This code was modified in the following ways:

1) The audio track was changed to a piece I wrote and recorded, called Creepy Town.
2) A separate Cascading Stylesheet now sets a different font (Papyrus), a new background color (dark blue/green),and a different score color (aqua).
3) The HTML was changed. I got rid of both of the links to the code downloads (since they aren't on my website), and changed the 'butterflies collected' message to 'Books Collected'.
4) All the sprites and pngs are new, and created by myself (Liz Altmiller).
5) I changed the person.js file so that it runs the new 'umbrella-sprite' correctly.
6) I changed the butterfly.js file so that it runs the 'book-sprite' correctly.
7) And finally, I added another if statement in the platformer.js file that changes the font color and style of the win message, shows a win screen, and re-starts the game if you stay on the page long enough. 
8) You may notice that if you mess with the volume, or try the external link, the speed doubles every time you click. I will have to try and fix this later, as I've already spent 14 hours working on this game project, 11 of which were trying to figure out the code. I would really like to get some more in depth training on JavaScript, as it doesn't seem to behave at ALL like Java or C#. I had a surprising amount of dificulty getting it to do what I needed, and even had to ditch several game mods I wanted to do, due to lack of time. I would like to become proficient in this language, but need more instruction in it, or at least time to go through the w3 school curriculum in it's entirety.
